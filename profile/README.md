## About zkSync

zkSync is a trustless protocol for scalable low-cost payments on Ethereum, powered by [zkRollup technology](https://zksync.io/faq/tech.html#zk-rollup-architecture). It uses
zero-knowledge proofs and on-chain data availability to keep users' funds as safe as though they never left the mainnet.

While security is our paramount priority, user and developer experience are central to zkSync design. We obsessively seek out improvements that eliminate friction and complexity in
order to make zkSync the most enjoyable platform on Ethereum, for both end-users and builders. The best way to get an impression about it is
to [try out zkSync](https://wallet.zksync.io/)
yourself — it should only take 2 minutes.

## Problems zkSync solves

Gas fees on Ethereum exceed $40M per month (opens new window). With zkSync these costs can be reduced to a small fraction.

UX-first crypto wallets like Argent (opens new window)or Dharma (opens new window)aim to provide a banking alternative to entire societies. zkSync makes this mission
accomplishable.

The rise of DeFi opens many more interesting use cases. zkSync is here to unlock Paypal-scale for your project.

## zkSync features

* Mainnet-level security with zero reliance on 3rd parties
* ETH and ERC20 token transfers with instant confirmations and 10-minute finality on L1¹; [see supported tokens](https://zksync.io/faq/tokens.html#supported-tokens)
* Ultra-low transaction fees (~1/100th of mainnet costs for ERC20 tokens and ~1/30th for ETH transfers)
* No registration is required to receive funds
* Payments to existing Ethereum addresses (including mart-contracts)
* Fees conveniently payable in the token being transferred Withdrawals to mainnet in ~10 minutes¹
* [Multisig](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/musig-schnorr-sig-scheme/The_MuSig_Schnorr_Signature_Scheme.html) support
* Permissionless smart contracts (_coming soon_)

  _¹ Currently, it may take longer to fill a block with transactions. Once the block is 'sealed', it is sent to the prover and appears on L1 within 10 minutes.

zkSync is an L2 protocol based on ZK rollup architecture. ZK rollup is a flavour of a larger "
rollup" family. For more background, we recommend Vitalik Buterin's [**2021 guide to rollups**](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html).

## Learning zkSync

zkSync has extensive and thorough [documentation](https://zksync.io/docs) and [video tutorials](https://zksync.io/faq/learnbywatching.html) to onboard you, making it a breeze to
get started.
